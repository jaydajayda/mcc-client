# Metropolitan Convention Center - Client

This repository is 1 of 3 microservices that make up the mock MCC Event Registration Application.
It provides an ReactJS Client for its adjacent HyperSQLDB service - [mcc-data](https://github.com/jaydajayda/mcc-data.git) and authentication service - [mcc-auth](https://github.com/jaydajayda/mcc-auth.git).

## Getting Started

`git clone git@github.com:jaydajayda/mcc-client.git`

`cd mcc-client`

`npm install`

`npm start`

*Note: MCC-Data and MCC-Auth APIs must be running for full client functionality.*
